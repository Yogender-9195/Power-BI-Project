# Power-BI-Project
USA Financial Data Analysis – Power BI Project
In this project, I analyzed financial data from the USA using Power BI to gain insights into key trends, patterns, and business performance. The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize the data effectively to support better decision-making.

# Data Loading & Cleaning
The first step was to load the dataset into Power Query. The raw data contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, which I cleaned using various data transformation techniques. I handled missing values, removed duplicates, corrected data formats, and ensured data integrity.
I also created conditional columns to categorize data based on specific conditions, helping to improve data segmentation and analysis.

# Data Transformation & Modeling
Once the data was cleaned, I performed several transformations to make it more structured and meaningful. I:

Merged datasets to bring together relevant financial data.
Applied DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create new calculated measures and columns.


# Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation
After preparing the data, I built interactive dashboards to present key financial metrics in a visually appealing way. The dashboard included:
# Bar & Column Charts – To show revenue, expenses, and profits across different periods.
# Line Charts – To visualize financial trends over time.
# KPI Cards – To highlight key metrics like total revenue, net profit, and growth rate.


# Conclusion
  This project allowed me to apply data cleaning, transformation, DAX formulas, and dashboard creation skills in Power BI. By structuring the data effectively and creating meaningful 
  visualizations, I was able to provide a clear financial overview that could assist businesses in making data-driven decisions.
